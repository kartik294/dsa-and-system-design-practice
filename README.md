# 🚀 SDE Preparation Journey — DSA & System Design

Hi! I'm documenting my Software Engineering interview preparation here.  
This repository contains my practice for **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **Low-Level Design (LLD)**.

The goal is to build strong problem-solving skills, write clean code, and understand design principles used in real-world systems.
